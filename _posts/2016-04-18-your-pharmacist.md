**Hello. **

My name is Hany Biskaly. By the coat, you can probably tell I'm a pharmacist, a key member of your health-care team. 

You may not know this but as a pharmacist, I have more training in medication therapy than any other heath-care provider in Canada, including your family doctor. That qualifies me to make sure your medications are appropriate for you. More than that, I can ensure your dosage is right and that there are no conflicts with other medications.

Did you know I can, where appropriate, renew your medication or even prescribe new medications? All with your consent, of course, and your doctor is always informed.

I am also uniquely qualified with specialized training to help you quit smoking, deal with diabetes and help you with lifestyle changes that will give you a longer, happier and healthier life. In fact, I can help you develop a personalized health-care plan that may well lessen your dependence on the medications you are currently taking.

I am always welcoming new patients. And the first consultation is FREE. Why not give me a call today at 613-680-5560 to set up an appointment? Or, you can book a your consultation online right now!
