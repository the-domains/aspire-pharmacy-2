**A healthier, happier life**

The quality of your life depends heavily on the decisions you make. 

At Aspire Pharmacy, we want to be more than just a friendly face on the other side of the counter. We want to be your health coach. We provide the information you need to make sound decisions about your health care. And with access to Canada's biggest health-care wholesalers, we are also able to provide almost any product you needs to assist in your treatment.

We are. . .

**Pharmaceutical specialists**--- Medications can be critical to the management of your heath care. If not used as prescribed, however, they can also cause serious harm, even death. More than half of Canadians do not take their medications properly.\[1\]

Are you one of them? 

\*1 out of 10 hospital admissions is due to people not taking their prescribed medications properly. For the elderly, that number jumps to 25 percent

\*adverse drug reactions are one of the leading causes of patient mortality\[2\],\[3\]

No other health-care professional has more medication-therapy training than your pharmacist. Not your nurse, not your specialist, not your family doctor. 

Our goal is to do more than make sure you are taking the right medication at the proper dosage. We want to help you achieve the best possible health outcomes with as little medication as possible.

**Certified Diabetes Educators**--- From nutrition, weight management and lifestyle advice (physical activity, stress management) to education, equipment and medications, we are specially trained to help you live a long and happy life _despite _your diabetes.

Smoking-cessation experts --- One in five Canadians still smoke according to Statistics Canada. And those who continue to smoke could lose up to nine years of life expectancy.\[4\]

Knowing that, why is it so hard to quit? Because of nicotine, a chemical that is as addictive as heroin or cocaine.\[5\]

But we can help you kick the habit through education, counselling and, when appropriate, medications. You can do it!

**Weight-loss professionals **--- Obesity---excess body fat that can threaten or affect your health---has become an epidemic in Canada. Six million Canadians are now living with obesity and may require immediate support in managing and controlling their weight. If you are having trouble keeping a health weight, we can help.

At Aspire Pharmacy and Health-coaching Service, we are more than pharmacists. We are your partners in health. We provide the tools and information you need to stay healthy.

Call us now at 613-680-5560---your first appointment is FREE. Or, you can book your consultation online right now! Get on track to become the healthiest you yet!
